# First Landing

## Purpose 
FirstLanding is a landing page that showcases my other landing pages. This project helps me practice styling, design, and experimenting with new technologies like Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap. Itâ€™s named "FirstLanding" as it represents one of my first landing page projects, inspired by the first moon landing.

## Pages 
| Title       | Description                        | Technology Used    |

| [First Landing](https://firstlandings.netlify.app/) | First landing page that acts as a home to all other landing pages. | React, CSS
